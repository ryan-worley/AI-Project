# Abstract class: an RLAlgorithm performs reinforcement learning.  All it needs
# to know is the set of available actions to take.  The simulator (see
# simulate()) will call getAction() to get an action, perform the action, and
# then provide feedback (via incorporateFeedback()) to the RL algorithm, so it can adjust
# its parameters.

    # |action| in state |state| resulted in reward |reward| and a transition to state
